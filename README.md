# Project Overview
This project is meant to satisfy the Phase #1 Project requirements for the Flatiron School Software Engineering Curriculum. 

# Objectives
- Design and architect features across a frontend
- Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
- Integrate JavaScript and an external API (or created API via JSON Server)
- Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
- Build and iterate on a project MVP

# Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

### Stretch Goals
Use json-server in your project to persist your app's interactivity.

# Usage and Functions
This webapp will allow the user to look up yoga poses based on a set of user provide criteria and save the poses to to create a practice sequence that is saved to the database for future recall.

# Sources and Inspiration
My wife is working on her Yoga Teacher Training (YTT) and having an on hand reference to search for poses based on different criteria will help her to create unique classes that still follow traditional sequences.
